## My Writeup Siteâ„¢

This project showcases a website designed for both desktop and mobile devices, featuring a comprehensive collection of writeups for multiple rooms from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/).

The primary goals of creating this project were:
- **Showcasing progress** - Maintaining a record of my journey allows me or other people to track my progress and growth over time.
- **Better knowledge retention** - Documenting solutions helped to solifidy and retain the knowledge that I have acquired while completing a room.
- **Improved documentation skills** - Writing detailted and clear documentation is a valuable skill which I have now partly acquired.
- **Knowledge contribution** - Sharing my writeups might save someone a lot of headache or help them to learn something new.
- **I like making sites**

Thanks to this project, I became a top 1% user worldwide on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/SCHIZOFRENIA)
